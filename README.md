# GenAI

This repository contains a collection of projects exploring various aspects of Generative AI, leveraging technologies like Langchain, Ollama models, Streamlit, and more. **These projects are inspired by and draw upon concepts and techniques presented in Krish Naik's Gen AI course.** I've expanded on these ideas, incorporated my own experiments, and documented my learning process.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a central hub for my explorations in the exciting field of Generative AI. I've been experimenting with different tools and techniques, and this is where I document my journey and projects.  You'll find examples using Langchain for building conversational AI, leveraging Ollama models for local inference, and Streamlit for interactive UIs. The goal is to learn, build, and share my insights with the community.

## Projects

Here's an overview of the projects included in this repository:

### Project 1: Project Title 1

**Description:** [ *Provide a concise and clear description of what this project does. For example, "This project implements a simple chatbot using Langchain and a local Ollama model."* ]

**Key Features:**
   - [ *Feature 1 - e.g., Chat interaction with a user* ]
   - [ *Feature 2 - e.g., Summarization of text using the model* ]

## Technologies Used

*   **Langchain:**  [ *Briefly explain Langchain's role in your projects. E.g., "Used for building conversational AI applications and managing interactions with language models."* ]
*   **Ollama:** [ *Explain why you're using Ollama. E.g., "Used for running local large language models, enabling fast and private inference."* ]
*   **Streamlit:** [ *Explain Streamlit. E.g., "Used for creating interactive web UIs for easy interaction with AI models."* ]
*   **Python:** [ *Mention if python is used for code.* ]
*   [ *Any Other Technology Used* ]

## Setup

This section provides instructions on setting up the projects locally.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Make sure you have Python [Version X.X or higher] installed. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Pip:** Make sure you have pip installed. This is the package installer for python.
*   **Ollama:**  You'll need Ollama installed.  Follow the installation instructions here: [Link to Ollama Install Instructions](https://ollama.com/)
*   [ *Any other specific requirements, e.g., API keys, libraries* ]

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Gen-AI.git
    cd Gen-AI
    ```
2. For each project directory, install the required dependencies :
    ```bash
    cd project1
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ../project2
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ../project2/subproject
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ../../project3
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. [ *Add any specific installation instructions for different projects or components.* ]

## Usage

[ *Explain how to run each project. Provide specific commands and instructions for the user to get started. For example:* ]

To run Project 1:
    ```bash
    cd project1
    python main.py
    ```

To run Project 2:
