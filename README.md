# GenAI

This repository contains a collection of projects exploring various aspects of Generative AI, leveraging technologies like Langchain, Ollama models, Streamlit, and more. **These projects are inspired by and draw upon concepts and techniques presented in Krish Naik's Gen AI course.** I've expanded on these ideas, incorporated my own experiments, and documented my learning process.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a central hub for my explorations in the exciting field of Generative AI. I've been experimenting with different tools and techniques, and this is where I document my journey and projects.  You'll find examples using Langchain for building conversational AI, leveraging Ollama models for local inference, and Streamlit for interactive UIs. The goal is to learn, build, and share my insights with the community.
